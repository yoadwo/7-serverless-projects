# AWS Project-Oriented Learning
This repository will help preparing for the AWS Developer Assiciate Exam. Each sub-directory will contain a different project, with increasing levels of complexity.
Hopefully each project will have both _serverless framework_ and _AWS SAM_ deployment methods.
The ideas were all taken from the article [How to Learn Serverless AWS by Building 7 Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-serverless-aws-by-building-7-projects/)

## Current Status
1. URL Shortener - _serverless framework_ and _AWS SAM_.
2. Reminder - _serverless framework_; _Angular_ client.
